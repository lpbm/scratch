# Scratch

This project can be used to host an online HTML scratch pad.

If you ever missed a "virtual" piece of paper to write a quick idea and have it available from anywhere else with an internet connection, well, this can be it.

It allows you to claim any free page on a it's domain and edit it, saving is done automatically.

You can protect it with a password using the icon in the upper-right corner.
